# Workout Calorie Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based tool that predicts the number of calories burned during a workout based on user input. It's built using Python and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## How It Works
1. You provide some information about yourself and your workout.
2. The information will then be used to predict calorie burn using machine learning.

## Methods Used
1. Data Preparation: Cleaned and processed a large dataset using Pandas.
2. Model Selection: Implemented a Linear Regression model for simplicity.
3. Training and Validation: Scaled and split the data into a ratio of 80:20 using Scikit-Learn.
4. Deployment: Employed Streamlit for its simple user interface.

## Transparency
For transparency purposes, we leveraged advanced AI-powered technology to enhance our debugging process.

## Installation 
1. Clone this repository
2. Install the necessary packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
